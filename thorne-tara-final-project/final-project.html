                    As you are driving down a quiet country road you turn off the road on to a paved road that heads up a hill. When you reach the top you see a big iron gate and as you you go through the gates you are greeted by line of fencing. All you see is mounds of grass and you hear the sounds of horses all around you. You look around and you see beautifully colored horses mixed with solid horses. After climbing out of your vehicle you walk through the glass doors into the barn you come across a woman taking a horse out of a stall and you are greeted.
                </p>

                <h2>About Our Training Program</h2>
                <p>
                    We select world-class horses with movement and athletic ability and we breed sensitive, medium types as prospects. We like elegant horses with good temperaments and bloodline. Horse's that we choose are accepted on a "Trial Basis" to determine whether or not the horse will work in our program. Provided that a horse's temperament is willing and generous the horse might be accepted into the Down The Rail Training Program. Not all horses and people work well together and it is important to us that the horses in our program are happy.

                <p> <strong>16.0 hh 2002 Sorrel Overo Mare</strong> <br />
                    Investment Art is a strong willed mare who tries to proclaim dominance on all of those around her. When turned out with the other young horses, Investment Art is constantly chasing and nipping at them. Once she has proved to them daily that she is queen of the paddock, they all settle down to graze and have fun in the sun. When being worked with, Investment Art is constantly pushing the limits, she tosses her head, crow hops, and will even throw out the occasional hoof up front to catch you in the shin. Investment Art will never be described as sweet and gentle.

We can't wait to start Artful Moves under saddle he is going to be phenomenal in the Hunter Under Saddle arena. And we believe that when he's old enough he's going to do great over fences and with his trot he'll make a stellar Pleasure Driving horse.</p>
