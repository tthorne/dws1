		<p>Prep: 20mn</br> Total: 1hr 20mn</p>
		<h2>Recipe taken from CenterCutCook.com</h2>
		<h3>Ingredient List</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 package regular Oreo cookies (Not Double Stuff) – about 36 cookies</li>
			<li>6 Tablespoon butter, melted</li>
			<li>1- 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened</li>
			<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
			<li>2 Tablespoons cold milk</li>
			<li>1- 12 ounce tub Cool Whip, divided</li>
			<li>2 – 3.9 ounce packages Chocolate Instant Pudding.</li>
			<li>3 1/4 cups cold milk</li>
			<li>1 and 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Begin by crushing 36 Oreo cookies. I used my food processor for this, but you could also place them in a large ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. When the Oreos have turned into fine crumbs, you are done.</li>
			<li>Transfer the Oreo crumbs to a large bowl. Stir in 6 tablespoons melted butter and use a fork to incorporate the butter into the cookie crumbs. When the butter is distributed, transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you work on the additional layers.</li>
			<li>Mix the cream cheese with a mixer until light and fluffy. Add in 2 Tablespoons of milk, and sugar, and mix well. Stir in 1 and 1/4 cups Cool Whip. Spread this mixture over the crust.</li>
			<li>In a bowl, combine chocolate instant pudding with 3 and 1/4 cups cold milk. Whisk for several minutes until the pudding starts to thicken. Use a spatula to spread the mixture over the previous cream cheese layer. Allow the dessert to rest for about 5 minutes so that the pudding can firm up further.</li>
			<li>Spread the remaining Cool Whip over the top. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips evenly over the top. Place in the freezer for 1 hour, or the refrigerator for 4 hours before serving.</li>
		</ol>
